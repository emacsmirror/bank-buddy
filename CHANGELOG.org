* Versions

** <2025-05-26> 0.2.2

Added CSV category enhancement functionality

- Enhanced CSV includes Category_Code and Category_Name columns
- Automatically creates enhanced CSV in report directory alongside reports
- Enables sorting and analysis of transactions by category in csv-mode

** <2025-05-09> 0.2.1

Improved the readability of the monthly progress comparison by inverting so the graph lines are always going to be clearer.

** <2025-04-26> 0.2.0

Removed all Babel blocks and now generate =gnuplot= data files and images through an external call-process. This means that the user still has the flexibility to modify a =gnuplot= output, but instead of modifying an embedded Babel gnuplot source block and regenerating the data, the files on disk can be modified. As a result, no Babel dependencies need to be installed, and there is no need to confirm a Babel block evaluation on each report load.

** <2025-04-26> 0.1.2
