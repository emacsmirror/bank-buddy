Bank Buddy is an Emacs package that provides financial analysis and reporting capabilities for your bank statements. It processes CSV bank statement data, categorizes transactions using customizable patterns, and generates detailed reports in Org-mode format.

It does not depend on any external account system, and the analysis is handled by =elisp=. The only external tool that may be required is =gnuplot= to visualize the generated data.

Here is an example of the type of report that is generated (obviously using test data :))

* Whats New

** <2025-05-26> 0.2.2

Added CSV category enhancement functionality

- Enhanced CSV includes Category_Code and Category_Name columns
- Automatically creates enhanced CSV in report directory alongside reports
- Enables sorting and analysis of transactions by category in csv-mode

Now, when you generate your financial reports, Bank Buddy automatically creates an enhanced CSV file with category information for every single transaction.

Every transaction in your bank statement now gets two additional columns:

- *Category_Code*: The 3-letter category code (like "fod" for food, "trn" for transport)
- *Category_Name*: The human-readable category name (like "Food", "Transport", "Amazon")

This enhanced CSV is automatically saved alongside your report, giving you the raw categorized data for deeper analysis.

Open the enhanced CSV in Emacs and use =csv-mode= for expense investigation:

*Sort by category to group similar expenses:*
#+begin_src 
M-x csv-mode
C-c C-s  (csv-sort-fields)
#+end_src

Choose the Category_Name column, and all your food expenses are grouped together and you can see patterns you never noticed before.

The enhancement works automatically with existing Bank Buddy workflows:

1. Run =M-x bank-buddy-generate= on your CSV file
2. Find the =*_with_categories.csv= file in your report directory
3. Open it in Emacs and enable =csv-mode=
4. Start sorting and investigating

You can also create enhanced CSVs without full reports using =M-x bank-buddy-create-enhanced-csv-only=.

** <2025-05-09> 0.2.1

Improved the readability of the monthly progress comparison by inverting so the graph lines are always going to be clearer.

** <2025-04-26> 0.2.0

*Major update*: Removed all Org Babel blocks and now generate =gnuplot= data files and images through an external call-process. This means that the user still has the flexibility to modify a =gnuplot= output, but instead of modifying an embedded Babel gnuplot source block and regenerating the data, the files on disk can be modified. As a result, no Babel dependencies need to be installed, and there is no need to confirm Babel block evaluation on each report load.

** <2025-04-26> 0.1.2

- Added monthly transaction counts

This section shows the number of transactions processed for each month.

** <2025-04-12> 0.1.1

Removed csv package dependency

** <2025-04-09> 0.1.0

Refactor code and improve customization options

- Remove redundant comments and simplify code structure.
- Enhance customization options by adding =defcustom= for user settings.
- Introduce new functions for better code modularity and maintainability.
- Adjust plots and visualization settings for improved clarity.

* Getting Started

** Installation

*** Dependencies

- Emacs 26.1 or later
- async.el
- gnuplot (system installation)

*** MELPA

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package bank-buddy)
(with-eval-after-load 'bank-buddy
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'bank-buddy-cat-maybe-enable))

#+end_src

*** Manual Installation

Clone this repository:

#+begin_src
git clone https://github.com/captainflasmr/bank-buddy.git
#+end_src

**** init.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/bank-buddy")
(require 'bank-buddy)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'bank-buddy-cat-maybe-enable)
#+end_src

OR

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package bank-buddy
  :load-path "path/to/bank-buddy")

(with-eval-after-load 'bank-buddy
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'bank-buddy-cat-maybe-enable))
#+end_src

* Quick Start

1. Export your bank statement as a CSV file
2. Edit CSV using =csv-mode= for all lines to the format DATE,DESCRIPTION,AMOUNT
3. Open CSV file
4. Run: =M-x bank-buddy-generate=
5. Open the generated report

* Generate gnuplots

Since version 0.2.0, Bank Buddy generates external gnuplot scripts that are executed via =call-process=. You need to have gnuplot installed on your system.

To install gnuplot:
- Linux: =sudo apt install gnuplot= (or equivalent for your distribution)
- macOS: =brew install gnuplot=
- Windows: Download from http://www.gnuplot.info/

The generated reports will include links to both the gnuplot script files (.gp) and data files (.dat) for each visualization. This allows for:
- Easy customization of plots by editing the gnuplot scripts
- Regeneration of plots without reprocessing the CSV data
- Better control over visualization settings

* Usage Guide

** Understanding CSV Format

Bank Buddy expects CSV files with at least the following columns:

- Transaction date
- Transaction description
- Debit amount

Different banks format their CSV exports differently. You may need to preprocess your CSV to match this format, I would advise to use the package =csv-mode=, open up a csv file and =C-c C-k= you way to removed unwanted columns so all you have left are those described above.

** Generating a Report

To generate a financial report:

#+begin_src 
M-x bank-buddy-generate-report

OR

M-x bank-buddy-generate
#+end_src

You'll be prompted to select an input CSV file and specify the output Org file.

The package processes the data asynchronously and a buffer will appear reporting on the analysis progress, so Emacs remains responsive even with large CSV files.

When processing is complete, you'll be asked if you want to open the generated report.

** Understanding the Report

A typical Bank Buddy report includes:

*** Summary Overview
- Total transactions analyzed
- Date range
- Total, average daily, and weekly spending

*** Top Spending Categories
- Ranked list of spending categories
- Total amount, percentage, and monthly/yearly averages
- Links to generated gnuplot scripts and data files

*** Monthly Spending Patterns
- Month-by-month spending visualization
- Category breakdown for each month
- Highest and lowest spending months
- Links to visualization files (*.gp, *.dat)

*** Monthly Category Breakdowns
- Detailed charts for each month showing spending by category
- Consistent color coding across months for easy comparison
- Links to individual gnuplot scripts for customization

*** Top Merchants
- Your highest-spending merchants
- Total amount, percentage, and monthly/yearly averages
- Links to generated visualization files

*** Recurring Subscriptions
- Detected recurring payments
- Estimated monthly cost
- Frequency analysis (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, annual)

*** Transaction Size Distribution
- Analysis of transaction sizes (under £10, £10-50, £50-100, over £100)

*** Unmatched Transactions
- List of transactions that didn't match specific categories
- Suggested patterns to add to your customization
  
** Managing Transaction Categories

Bank Buddy comes with predefined category patterns, but you'll likely want to customize these for your personal transactions. The package includes an interactive mode for managing categories.

When viewing a report, you can:

1. Navigate to an unmatched transaction (in the "Unmatched Transactions" section)
2. Press =C-c C-a= to add it to a category
3. Choose an existing category or create a new one
4. Optionally save the updated category definitions to your init file
5. Regenerate the report to see the changes

To manage existing categories or add new ones manually, customize =bank-buddy-core-cat-list-defines=.

** Category Format

Categories are defined as patterns in the form:

#+begin_src elisp
(REGEX-PATTERN CATEGORY-CODE)
#+end_src

Where:
- =REGEX-PATTERN= is a regular expression that matches transaction descriptions
- =CATEGORY-CODE= is a short code representing the category (e.g., "fod" for food)

For example:
#+begin_src elisp
("amazon\\|amz" "amz")  ; Amazon purchases
("netflix\\|spotify\\|youtube" "str")  ; Streaming services
#+end_src

You can customize category codes and their display names by modifying =bank-buddy-core-category-names=.

** Updating and Regenerating Reports

If you add or modify category patterns after generating a report:

1. With the report open, enable Bank Buddy Category mode if not already active: =M-x bank-buddy-cat-mode=
2. Press =C-c C-r= to regenerate the report with the updated categories

The report will be refreshed with the new categorization rules.

** Working with Unmatched Transactions

To quickly view and manage unmatched transactions:

#+begin_src 
M-x bank-buddy-view-unmatched-transactions
#+end_src

This opens a buffer showing transactions that weren't matched by specific patterns, with suggestions for adding them to your category definitions.

* Example Workflow

- *Generate Initial Report*
   #+begin_src 
   M-x bank-buddy-generate-report
   #+end_src

- *Review Unmatched Transactions*
   Navigate to the "Unmatched Transactions" section of the report.

- *Categorize Transactions*
   - Place cursor on an unmatched transaction
   - =C-c C-a= to add it to a category
   - Choose an existing category or create a new one

- *Regenerate Report*
   - =C-c C-r= to see your changes

- *Save Category Definitions*
   When prompted, choose to save your category definitions to your init file.

- *View and Customize Plots*
   - Click on the links to gnuplot scripts (.gp) in the report
   - Edit the scripts to customize visualization
   - Run them with =gnuplot script.gp= to regenerate plots

* Customization

** Core Settings

#+begin_src elisp
;; Exclude large transactions from analysis
(setq bank-buddy-core-exclude-large-txns t)
(setq bank-buddy-core-large-txn-threshold 2000)

;; Number of occurrences to detect subscriptions
(setq bank-buddy-core-subscription-min-occurrences 3)

;; Number of top items to display
(setq bank-buddy-core-top-spending-categories 5)
(setq bank-buddy-core-top-merchants 5)
#+end_src

** Customizing Category Patterns

You can customize the category patterns by setting =bank-buddy-core-cat-list-defines=:

#+begin_src elisp
(customize-set-variable 'bank-buddy-core-cat-list-defines
  '(("amazon\\|amz" "amz")
    ("netflix\\|spotify" "str")
    ("uber\\|lyft" "txi")
    ("sainsburys\\|tesco\\|asda" "fod")
    ;; Add your own patterns here
    (".*" "o")))  ; Catch-all pattern should be last
#+end_src

** Customizing Category Names

Category codes are mapped to human-readable names via =bank-buddy-core-category-names=:

#+begin_src elisp
(customize-set-variable 'bank-buddy-core-category-names
  '(("amz" . "Amazon")
    ("str" . "Streaming Services")
    ("txi" . "Taxi & Rideshare")
    ("fod" . "Groceries")
    ;; Add your own mappings here
    ("o" . "Other")))
#+end_src

** Customizing Subscription Detection

Define subscription patterns for better detection of recurring payments:

#+begin_src elisp
(customize-set-variable 'bank-buddy-core-subscription-patterns
  '(("NETFLIX" . "Netflix")
    ("SPOTIFY" . "Spotify")
    ("AMAZON PRIME" . "Amazon Prime")
    ;; Add your own patterns here
    ))
#+end_src

* Advanced Usage

** Integration with Other Financial Tools

Bank Buddy reports are generated as Org-mode files, making them compatible with other Org-based tools:

- Export to HTML, PDF, or other formats with Org export functions
- Use =org-capture= to add notes to specific transactions or categories

** Custom Visualization

Bank Buddy generates visualizations using external gnuplot scripts. You can customize these by:

1. Editing the generated .gp files in the report directory
2. Creating your own gnuplot scripts based on the generated .dat files
3. Running the scripts manually with =gnuplot filename.gp=

** Keyboard Shortcuts

When viewing a report with =bank-buddy-cat-mode= enabled:

- =C-c C-a=: Add the transaction at point to a category
- =C-c C-r=: Regenerate the report with current category definitions

* Caveats and Tips

- *CSV Format*: Bank Buddy expects a CSV with date, description, and amount columns
- *Performance*: For very large CSV files (10K+ rows), the async processing helps but may still take time
- *Categorization*: Start with broad patterns and refine as needed
- *Visualization*: Ensure gnuplot is installed on your system for chart generation
- *Saving Patterns*: Always save your category patterns to persist between sessions

* Comparison with Other Financial Packages

Several Emacs packages exist for financial management, but they serve different purposes. Here's how Bank Buddy compares to other notable financial packages:

** Ledger-mode

[[https://github.com/ledger/ledger-mode][Ledger-mode]] is an Emacs interface to the command-line Ledger accounting system.

*Key differences:*
- Ledger is a complete double-entry accounting system; Bank Buddy is focused on bank statement analysis
- Ledger requires manual transaction entry or carefully formatted imports; Bank Buddy automates categorization
- Ledger offers more comprehensive accounting features (accounts, assets, liabilities); Bank Buddy focuses on spending insights
- Bank Buddy provides visual spending breakdowns and charts; Ledger focuses on accurate accounting

*When to use Ledger:* For complete personal finance tracking, investments, budgeting, and double-entry accounting.  
*When to use Bank Buddy:* For quick analysis of bank statements and visualizing spending patterns.

** HLedger-mode

[[https://github.com/narendraj9/hledger-mode][HLedger-mode]] is an Emacs major mode for working with hledger, a plain-text accounting system similar to Ledger.

*Key differences:*
- HLedger, like Ledger, is a full double-entry accounting system; Bank Buddy focuses on bank statement analysis
- HLedger requires manual transaction entry or formatted imports; Bank Buddy automates categorization
- HLedger offers comprehensive accounting features (multiple currencies, time reporting); Bank Buddy emphasizes spending insights
- Bank Buddy provides visual spending breakdowns; HLedger focuses on textual reports and balances

*When to use HLedger-mode:* For detailed personal finance tracking, multi-currency support, and generating various financial reports.  
*When to use Bank Buddy:* For quick analysis of bank statements and visualizing spending patterns without learning a full accounting system.

** Elbank

[[https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Elbank][Elbank]] is a personal finance reporting tool for Emacs that uses Weboob to fetch data from bank websites.

*Key differences:*
- Elbank can automatically fetch transactions from supported banks; Bank Buddy works with CSV exports
- Elbank focuses on reporting and visualization; Bank Buddy offers both analysis and reporting
- Elbank requires Weboob setup and configuration; Bank Buddy works directly with CSV files
- Bank Buddy provides customizable transaction categorization; Elbank may rely on bank-provided categories

*When to use Elbank:* For automated tracking of multiple bank accounts with direct data fetching and basic reporting.  
*When to use Bank Buddy:* For detailed analysis and categorization of bank statements, especially when working with CSV exports or when bank integration isn't available or desired.

** Beancount-mode

[[https://github.com/beancount/beancount-mode][Beancount-mode]] is an Emacs mode for Beancount, another plain-text accounting system.

*Key differences:*
- Beancount, like Ledger, is a full double-entry accounting system
- Beancount has stricter syntax requirements than Ledger
- Bank Buddy offers automatic categorization and reporting, while Beancount requires manual entry
- Beancount generates sophisticated reports, but requires more setup and knowledge

*When to use Beancount:* For precise, auditable personal accounting with strict validation.  
*When to use Bank Buddy:* For simple spending analysis without learning accounting principles.

** csv-mode and orgtbl-mode

Some users analyze financial CSV data using built-in Emacs packages like csv-mode combined with org-table functionality.

*Key differences:*
- These are general-purpose tools that require manual customization for financial analysis
- Bank Buddy provides specialized, financial-specific analysis and visualization
- Bank Buddy automatically categorizes transactions based on patterns
- Bank Buddy generates reports without manual processing

*When to use csv/orgtbl-mode:* For custom, one-off analysis of financial data.  
*When to use Bank Buddy:* For consistent, repeatable analysis of bank statements.

** TODO parsing can't handle carriage returns at end of file!!

* Troubleshooting

** CSV Parsing Issues

If your bank's CSV format is not recognized:

1. Check that your CSV has columns for date, description, and debit amount
2. Pre-process the CSV if necessary to match the expected format
3. Check for encoding issues if you see garbled text in reports

** Performance Considerations

Bank Buddy processes CSV files asynchronously to avoid blocking Emacs. However, with very large files:

1. Initial parsing may take longer
2. Generated reports might be large
3. Consider filtering or pre-processing very large CSV files

** Common Issues

- *Unmatched Transactions*: Review and add patterns for your common merchants
- *Duplicate Categories*: Check for overlapping regex patterns
- *Date Format Issues*: Ensure dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format for best results
- *Gnuplot Not Found*: Ensure gnuplot is installed and available in your PATH
